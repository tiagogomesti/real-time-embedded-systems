# Instructions
Download, modify , and build example code for hello world main and creation of pthread which involves basic thread creation.
Submit the syslog file with the logs printed as below guidelines.

1. Print the output of uname -a in the first line of the syslog file. 
2. Each syslog statement should have `[COURSE:X][ASSIGNMENT:Y]` where `X` corresponds to Course Number i.e. 1 in this case and `Y` corresponds to Assignment No. 

Example: `Aug 30 22:10:54 raspberrypi pthread: [COURSE:1][ASSIGNMENT:1] YOUR DATA HERE`

This is what your output should look like. Also, please note that the uname output is generated from the program and not copied from the terminal and pasted into the program as a string.
All syslog prints in this assignment and upcoming assignments shall follow this format. (The time, name of the machine, and the program name are generated by syslog, you do not need to add them in manually).

3. This assignment expects two log statements as below from the main and the thread in execution
* Hello World from Main! 
* Hello World from Thread!
